# voltron2-spikes

This code was used to process .nd2 files from Voltron2 imaging of E1 neurons in Brown _et al._ 2023. 

It motion corrects videos, automatically identifies an ROI, corrects for photobleaching, approximates baseline membrane potential, and identifies spikes.

The code is not perfect and may require some manual correction.
